Stores files to be part of the Eclipse Codewind landing and documentation pages. 

* This repository is a staging environment for creating the live Eclipse Codewind website
* The live website is located at [https://www.eclipse.org/codewind](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind)
* The live website repository is at: [https://git.eclipse.org/c/www.eclipse.org/codewind.git/](https://git.eclipse.org/c/www.eclipse.org/codewind.git/). The files from this repository will be commited to the live website repository. This repository will contain documentation files (MD files) that are transformed into HTML files. As a result, this repository will not contain the same files as the live website repository
